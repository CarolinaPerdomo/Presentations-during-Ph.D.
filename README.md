# Presentations-during-Ph.D. :arrow_upper_right:

In this repository, you can find a part of the presentations that I made in the last 2 years of my Ph.D :zany_face: . During this time, I participated in the UFABC's Journal Club and, I did an research exchange in Portugal. I have presented my research results at international conferences and written scientific articles (technical and informative). Based on this, I developed professional attitudes such as autonomy, decision-making, pedagogy, and team-work. Active interpersonal communication is one of my best skills :grin:.

As a researcher, one of my responsibilities is to transmit my work to new audiences and potential collaborators :monocle_face: . The ability to communicate technical aspects and persuade others of their importance has been a crucial part of my work, both to obtain financing and make strategic decisions in the work plans. As a Ph.D. researcher, I was able to understand problems and adapt them in terms of analysis. On top of that, I love presenting complex ideas in a clear, creative, and concise way :partying_face: . In that sense, I adapt to my interlocutors. All this has been critical to voice the algorithms we developed during my Ph.D., encourage others to use them, and establish collaborations with other institutions.

Examples where my communication skills have been decisive:

### During my doctorate, I wrote a research proposal that allowed us to obtain [financing](https://propg.ufabc.edu.br/wp-content/uploads/ASSINADO_Resultado-Final-Edital-26-2020-Doutorado-Sanduíche.pdf) to develop new automation tools in our field for eight months in Portugal at the University of Coimbra. This experience ultimately brought a positive feedback for our computational techniques and the publication of two scientific articles:

- ["Two-loop renormalisation of gauge theories in 4D Implicit Regularisation: transition rules to dimensional methods"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-021-09259-6) :bookmark_tabs:,
- ["A Brief Review of Implicit Regularization and Its Connection with the BPHZ Theorem"](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/13/6/956) :bookmark_tabs:,

### The preliminary results of the first article were presented at the national event "Encontro Virtual de Teoría de Campos", held on December 2-4, 2020:

- A video [poster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPu9YLNv4GU) was prepared to be presented.

### The 2 published articles were also presented at 2 international conferences:

- PARTICLEFACE 2021: Unraveling New Physics Workshop, where the beneficiary was invited to be a member of the European network team, COST action CA16201.
- The European Physical Society Conference on High Energy Physics (EPS-HEP) 2021: where a [poster](https://indico.desy.de/event/28202/contributions/105065/) was developed and presented.

### A collaboration was signed with the University of Coimbra where I became [Collaborating member](https://cfisuc.fis.uc.pt/people.php?oid=9025232) of the Physics Center of the University of Coimbra in order to open new doors of cooperation between the research group in Brazil and Portugal :relaxed: .
